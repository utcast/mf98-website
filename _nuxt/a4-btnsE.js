　The three squares on the right in the upper left corner and the top three squares in the lower left corner represent a mask over the QR Code; a QR Code becomes difficult to read if too many squares of the same color are clustered together. It is difficult to tell where one square is from another. To prevent this, the rule of reversing the black and white in a certain area is called a mask. For example, in the QR Code you just filled in, three squares are black and white. In this case, the red areas in the image below are the opposite of black and white.
