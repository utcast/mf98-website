When these four squares are unmasked, they become black-and-white and white-and-white. This means that the QR Code data is written in 8-bit byte mode, which is the mode in which 8 squares represent one character. 8-bit byte mode is used when writing url in QR Code. <br>
　The eight squares surrounded by green lines next to the mode indicator are called character count indicators. As the name suggests, it indicates the number of characters in the url. When unmasked, they are white-white-black-white-black-white. This is a binary number, and if we convert it to the decimal number we are familiar with, we see that it is 36, which matches the number of characters in the url for this page. <br>

　The four squares surrounded by yellow after the end of the url character are white-white-white-white when the mask is unmasked. This is a termination pattern, indicating that the url character ends here. <br>
　The squares enclosed in red after the terminal pattern, when unmasked, continue the pattern for 16 squares: black-black-black-black-white-black-white-white-white-black. This pattern is called a fill-in-the-blank word, and it fills in the excess QR Code data. <br>
